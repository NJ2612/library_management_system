A Library Management System (LMS) is an advanced digital tool designed to efficiently manage and automate various library operations. This system streamlines traditional library tasks such as cataloging books, tracking issued and returned materials, maintaining user records, and calculating fines for overdue books. By transitioning from manual processes to an automated platform, libraries can enhance accuracy, reduce labor-intensive tasks, and improve user experiences.

The LMS allows librarians to manage inventory, add or remove books, and oversee user memberships with ease. Simultaneously, it empowers users to search for books, access borrowing history, and explore digital resources. Modern LMS implementations often include additional features such as integration with news, digital notes, and access to online information platforms like Wikipedia.
